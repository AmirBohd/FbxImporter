# FbxImporter

Tool for importing fbx meshes into flver model files. Works with Dark Souls 3, Sekiro and Elden Ring.
Supports vertex buffer layouts required by vertex deformed cloth meshes and can reorder their vertices to fit the physics file.

Special thanks to TKGP for Soulsformats and Meowmaritus for SoulsAssetPipeline.
